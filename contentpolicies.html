        <p>
          Welcome to Bushel, a Christian social networking platform designed to connect churches, churchgoers, and believers in a safe, faith-centered environment. Our mission is to foster fellowship, encouragement, and spiritual growth rooted in biblical principles. To maintain a Christ-honoring community, we’ve established this Content Policy Guide. All users are expected to adhere to these standards, reflecting the values of love, purity, and respect found in Scripture (e.g., Philippians 4:8, Ephesians 4:29).
        </p>

        <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
        <p>
          Bushel’s content policies are grounded in Christian teachings, emphasizing holiness, modesty, and edification. We aim to create a space where users can freely share their faith without compromising biblical integrity. Content that conflicts with these values, including anything that could be loosely considered "adult," is strictly prohibited.
        </p>

        <h2>Content Standards</h2>
        <h5>1. General Conduct</h5>
        <p>
          Encouragement and Edification: Posts, comments, and interactions must uplift others and align with Christian love and kindness (Colossians 3:12-14).
        </p>
        <p>
          No Profanity or Vulgarity: Language must remain clean and free of swearing, crude references, or suggestive terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Respectful Dialogue: Disagreements should be handled with grace and humility, avoiding hostility or personal attacks (Proverbs 15:1).
        </p>

        <h5>2. Prohibited Content</h5>
        <p>
          <b>The following content is not permitted on Bushel under any circumstances:</b>
        </p>
        <h6>Adult or Inappropriate Material:  </h6>
        <p>
          No nudity, sexual references, suggestive imagery, or discussions of explicit topics (1 Thessalonians 4:3-5).
        </p>
        <p>
          No content promoting lust, adultery, or immorality, even if subtle or implied.
        </p>

        <p>Violence and Gore: No depictions of graphic violence, harm, or cruelty.  </p>
        <p>Substance Abuse: No promotion or glorification of illegal drugs, excessive alcohol use, or intoxication.  </p>
        <p>Hate Speech: No content that attacks individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, or other traits (Galatians 3:28).  </p>
        <p>False Teachings: No promotion of doctrines or beliefs that contradict core Christian tenets (e.g., the Trinity, salvation through Christ – John 14:6).  </p>
        <p>Spam or Commercial Solicitation: No unsolicited advertising, scams, or unrelated promotions.</p>

        <h2>Faith-Based Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Scriptural Alignment: Content should reflect or be compatible with biblical teachings. Discussions of faith must remain respectful and avoid blasphemy or mockery of God, Jesus Christ, or the Holy Spirit (Exodus 20:7).  </p>
        <p>Modesty: Photos, videos, and text should reflect Christian modesty in appearance and intent (1 Timothy 2:9-10).  </p>
        <p>Church Focus: Content should support the mission of connecting churches and believers—e.g., sharing sermons, events, prayer requests, or testimonies.</p>

        <h2>Media Uploads</h2>
        <p>Images and Videos: Must be family-friendly, free of suggestive or inappropriate elements, and relevant to Christian community-building.  </p>
        <p>Documents: PDFs, text files, or other uploads (e.g., Bible studies) must align with Bushel’s standards and avoid prohibited topics.</p>
